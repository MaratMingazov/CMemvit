# CMemvit

## Overview

CMemvit - Eclipse Plugin C/C++ memory visualization tool, integrated into [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/) for C/C++ developers.

CMemvit is based on idea of natural representation of process memory state. The key advantage of CMemvit from the visualization perspective is an opportunity to show stack and heap process memory areas with the maximum level of detail. This means that every element becomes visualized with specifying of its address in memory if it is technically possible.
